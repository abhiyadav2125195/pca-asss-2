    "A projection in the context of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a transformation of data from its original high-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional space (typically a subspace) that captures the most important information or variance in the data. In PCA, projections are used to find the principal components, which are linear combinations of the original features."

The optimal number of principal components is often determined by examining the explained variance or using cross-validation techniques."
